            <p>Left I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing 
                pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete 
                account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of 
                the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human
                 happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
                  because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how
                   to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are 
                   extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues 
                   or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
                    because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain
                     can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, 
                     which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except
                      to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to 
                      find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that
                       has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
                        produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand
                        , we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, 
                that they cannot foresee
