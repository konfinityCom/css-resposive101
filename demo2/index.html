                   or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
                    because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain
                     can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, 
                     which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except
                      to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to 
                      find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that
                       has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
                        produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand
